This work proposes the application of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based proxy model in well placement optimization problem involving pressure management of GCS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated by optimizing the placement of the CO2 injection and brine extraction wells in the upper aquifer of the Pohang Basin.

In this study, I created 4 ANN models (Base Model, Model A, Model B, Model C) with different input features. I also tuned the hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer) for each ANN model. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used for both optimization of well placement and hyperparameter tuning.
